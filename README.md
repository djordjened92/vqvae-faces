#  VQ-VAE for FIW

## 1. Introduction
This project is result of my learning process in the field of variational autoencoders. The dataset used for this use case is from project [**Families In the Wild**](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/fiw/index.html), specifficaly from the task [kinship verification](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22117). Competition, metrics and datasets are described in details in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06303.pdf).

[VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00937.pdf) is central autoencoder architecture, and [pixelCNN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/b1301141feffabac455e1f90a7de2054-Paper.pdf) is used for prior distribution estimation.
